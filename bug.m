This code attempts to access an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  This is a common error, but the subtle aspect here is that the out-of-bounds access only happens when a certain condition (the `if` statement) is met.  This makes it difficult to reproduce consistently and hence harder to debug using simple test cases.

```objectivec
- (void)someMethod:(NSArray *)myArray {
    NSInteger index = [self calculateIndex]; // Calculation may sometimes return a negative value

    if (index >= 0 && index < myArray.count) {
        // Accessing array element.  This is safe if the calculation is correct
        id element = myArray[index]; 
        NSLog(@"Element at index %ld: ", (long)index); 
    } else {
        //The error is here, because a potential error is not handled, if calculation is negative
        NSLog(@"Index out of bounds");
    }

    //This line will not be reached if index is negative
    if (myArray.count > 0){
        id lastElement = myArray[myArray.count - 1];
        NSLog(@"Last Element: %@
", lastElement);
    }
}
