This repository demonstrates a subtle Objective-C bug involving an array index out of bounds error. The error is triggered conditionally, making it harder to detect during standard testing.  The `bug.m` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version. The problem lies in the calculation of the array index and the handling of potential negative or out-of-bounds values.  The solution shows a robust way to handle such edge cases and prevent unexpected crashes.
